- **Quality:** High resolution but optimized for web (under 500KB per image ideally)
- **Color Grading:** Consistent color palette - warm, earthy, mystical tones
- **Mood:** Sacred, authentic, grounded, transformative

### **Style Preferences:**
- Natural lighting preferred over studio lighting
- Authentic moments over posed shots
- Earth tones, warm colors, sacred geometry
- Avoid overly saturated or heavily filtered images
- Balance darkness and light - honor both

### **Text Overlay Considerations:**
For images with text overlays:
- Leave space in composition for text (usually center or lower third)
- Images can be darker or have gradient overlays added in code
- Test text readability before finalizing
