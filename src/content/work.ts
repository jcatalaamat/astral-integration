    title: 'Ecosystem Realignment',
    context: 'An organization with years of accumulated offerings, content, and tools — none of which clearly connect or guide people toward engagement.',
    change: 'We mapped the existing landscape, identified what was still alive, and removed what had become noise. The remaining offerings were restructured into a clear progression.',
    built: 'A redesigned website with simplified navigation, a single clear entry point, and an offering structure that reflects the actual work.',
    outcome: 'People now understand what the organization does within seconds. Inquiries became more aligned. Internal clarity improved.'

    title: 'Offering Structure Cleanup',
    context: 'A practitioner with multiple services, programs, and ideas — but no clear way for people to know where to start or what fits.',
    change: 'We clarified the core offering, removed redundant options, and created a simple path from discovery to engagement.',
    built: 'A streamlined service menu, clear pricing, and a single intake form that routes people appropriately.',
    outcome: 'The practitioner stopped explaining their work repeatedly. Clients arrived already understanding the offering.'

    title: 'Booking, Payments & Onboarding',
    context: 'A service provider manually handling scheduling, invoicing, and client communication — losing hours each week to admin.',
    change: 'We designed an end-to-end flow that handles booking, payment, confirmation, and onboarding without manual intervention.',
    built: 'Integrated scheduling with payment processing, automated confirmation emails, and a client portal for session management.',
    outcome: 'Admin time dropped significantly. The provider focused on delivery instead of logistics.'

    title: 'Membership & Program Portal',
    context: 'A community leader with valuable content and a growing audience — but no structured way to offer ongoing access or membership.',
    change: "We designed a membership model that matched the community's rhythm, with clear tiers and value at each level.",
    built: 'A membership platform with content library, community space, and integrated payments. Simple to maintain, easy to navigate.',
    outcome: 'Recurring revenue stabilized. Members had a clear home. The leader could focus on creating, not managing.'

    title: 'Internal Ops & Automation',
    context: 'A small team drowning in spreadsheets, scattered tools, and manual processes — with no single source of truth.',
    change: 'We audited existing workflows, identified friction points, and designed a unified system that matched how the team actually works.',
    built: 'A central dashboard connecting project management, client data, and key metrics. Automated handoffs between stages.',
    outcome: 'The team stopped losing information. Decisions became faster. Onboarding new collaborators became straightforward.'
